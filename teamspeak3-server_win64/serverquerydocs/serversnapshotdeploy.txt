Usage: serversnapshotdeploy [-mapping] [-keepfiles] [password=secret] virtualserver_snapshot

Permissions:
  b_virtualserver_snapshot_deploy

Description:
  Restores the selected virtual servers configuration using the data from a
  previously created server snapshot. Please note that the TeamSpeak 3 Server
  does NOT check for necessary permissions while deploying a snapshot so the
  command could be abused to gain additional privileges. With -keepfiles set,
  the channels that exist on the virtualserver and the backup keep will have
  there files preserved.

Example:
  serversnapshotdeploy -keepfiles version=3 data=KLUv/WC5xVV9AKpopBIq4I6IHliw+idbGVkQpP/D....
  error id=0 msg=ok

  serversnapshotdeploy -mapping version=3 data=KLUv/WC5xVV9AKpopBIq4I6IHliw+idbGVkQpP/D....
  ocid=36 ncid=40|ocid=37 ncid=41|ocid=38 ncid=42|ocid=39 ncid=43
